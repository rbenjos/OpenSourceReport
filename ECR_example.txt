HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 57 year old
gentleman with a past medical history of Parkinson's Disease,
depression, anxiety, seizure disorder, coronary artery
disease status post inferior myocardial infarction, who was
found to be confused and walking in the streets disoriented
on the evening of the 14th.  EMS was called and he was
brought to [**Hospital1 69**] where he had
an altered mental status.  In the Emergency Department, he
was found to have an [**Hospital1 **] CK to 5,000, negative MB
fraction of less than 1% with a positive [**Hospital1 **] up to 20.
He had no EKG changes, however, he did have evidence of an
inferior myocardial infarction with Qs in the inferior leads
with a tall R wave in V2 consistent with a posterior
involvement.

The patient also had a bedside echocardiogram in the
Emergency Department which showed an ejection fraction of
approximately 30% with left ventricular dilation and global
left ventricular dysfunction, one plus aortic regurgitation,
three plus mitral regurgitation.  The patient was found to
have a white count [**Hospital1 **] to 17.4, being afebrile and an
anion gap was 17 with ketones in his urine.  He had a
negative head CT scan.  He had an lumbar puncture with 560
red blood cells in tube four, 470 in tube one, one white
blood cell, protein 49, glucose 70, no PMNs, no organisms on
Gram stain.

The patient initially received a dose of Ceftriaxone,
Acyclovir and Vancomycin.  The patient had a follow-up MRI /
MRA with no abnormalities.

The Cardiology Team was consulted and did not feel that the
patient was having an acute event that required cardiac
catheterization at the time of admission, and that the
patient's neurological mental status was more important as an
acute issue.  They recommended medical management.

The patient was started on aspirin, beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor and a statin.  Neurosurgery was consulted regarding
the red blood cells in the lumbar puncture tube.  They
recommended an MRI which showed no acute bleed or acute
parenchymal process.

Over the patient's Emergency Department course, the patient's
mental status improved.  He was alert and oriented times
three.  He did not recall the events of the day of admission.
He said he has been under a lot of stress with his car being
stolen last week.  He also reported running out of his
medicines and not taking them.

He reports having dreams that are like seizure-like events in
the evening.  He does not recall when his last seizure was
except for this ""seizure events"".

accident in [**2187-6-20**].  Since then, he has been on
disability.  Parkinson's for six years.  Care in the VA
system with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41058**] at the [**Hospital1 1559**] VA as the patient's
primary care physician.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation, temperature 98.0 F.;
pulse 96; blood pressure 133/60; respiratory rate 20;
saturation of 100% on room air.  He was alert and oriented
times three, disheveled.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.   Anicteric sclerae.  No lymphadenopathy, no jugular
venous distention.  No bruit.  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  He has no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Heart is
S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was nontender, nondistended, soft, with active bowel
sounds.  He had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  He had a pill rolling
tremor at baseline with increased cogwheel rigidity.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
17.4, and this was decreased to 12 on the day of discharge.
Hematocrit was 39 at admission; 31.7 on the day of discharge.
Platelets were 259 at date of admission and 208 on the date
of discharge

Sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride 101, bicarbonate 19 with
a gap of 17.  BUN 36, creatinine 1.0.  These were all
admission labs on the day of discharge.

The patient's creatinine was down to 0.8, BUN down to 18,
anion gap was down to 7.  When the patient presented, he had
ketones in his urine.  His toxicology screen was negative for
alcohol and all other substances.

His glucose was within normal limits.  His calcium was 8.8,
magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 3.1, lactate was 1.0.

When he presented, CK 5,712; on the day of discharge, this
was down to 1900.  On admission his MB index was less than
1.0, his [**Hospital1 **] was 20 at admission.  His MB index is 0.5
on the date of discharge, and his [**Hospital1 **] was 6 on the date
of discharge.

Albumin 3.7, total cholesterol 201, triglycerides 48, HDL 45,
LDL 146, B12 331, folate 5.5, TSH 1.8.  The patient's
Lamictal level is pending.

The patient's EKG shows sinus tachycardia on admission, left
axis deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy as per AVL
greater than 11 millimeters.  He has Q waves in the inferior
leads and a tall R in V2 consistent with an old inferior
posterior myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  This is a 57 year old male who presents with delta MS
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], [**Last Name (Titles) **] CKs with flat MB index.  For
delta MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 41059**] includes post-ictal state status
post seizure.  The patient mentions having events at night
that were consistent with seizures but he was not sure if
they were dreams or he was dreaming about having seizures, or
actually having seizures.  Delirium secondary to alcohol
withdrawal, but his tox screen was negative, although the
ketones in his urine and the anion gap were within normal
limits, glucose is suggestive of alcoholic ketosis; possible
encephalitis but the patient's lumbar puncture and MRI/MRA
were not consistent with this; secondary to psychiatric
manifestations of his neurological disorder.  The patient
carries a diagnosis of Parkinson's and possibly could have
[**Last Name (un) 309**] body involvement.  Neurology was consulted and was
following the patient.

An EEG was ordered but the patient refused to participate in
the EEG as it would involve the removal of his hairpiece.

The patient was continued on his Lamictal 150 twice a day on
his Sinemet 25/100 three times a day, Sinemet CR 50/200 four
times a day, Mirapex one three times a day.  He was also
continued on his venlafaxine and received ativan as well
p.r.n. for agitation.

Psychiatric saw the patient and generally thought his picture
was one of resolving delirium.  His mental status has
gradually improved during his course, although he does have
episodes of confabulation, flat affect and poor insight into
his overall medical condition.  The patient has threatened to
leave against medical advice multiple times during the
hospitalization.

Psychiatric has seen him and felt that he is unable at
different times to have insight and weigh the pros and
consequences of his leaving the hospital against medical
advice at the current time.

2.  [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **]:  Due to the high [**Last Name (un) **] at 20, the
patient denies any chest pain and no EKG changes.  The
patient either had a silent non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction or demand ischemia possibly secondary to
arrhythmia that may have lead to the patient being down.  The
[**Last Name (un) **] CKs are consistent with rhabdomyolysis not secondary
to a large ST elevation myocardial infarction as the MB index
was negative.  The patient was placed on beta blocker, 37.5
three times a day, aspirin 81 q. day; ACE inhibitor 12.5
three times a day of Captopril and 10 q. day of Lipitor.

The patient had an echocardiogram repeated at the bedside.
Ejection fraction was less or equal to 25%.  Right atrium
mildly dilated and left atrium mildly dilated.  Left
ventricular cavity mildly dilated.  Severe global left
ventricular hypertrophy, overall systolic left function
severely depressed.  Right ventricular chamber size is
normal.  Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed.  The aortic root is normal in diameter.  Four plus
mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, and
trace aortic regurgitation.

3.  ANION GAP ACIDOSIS:  Secondary to ketones, alcohol,
starvation.  The patient's anion gap resolved after
hydration.

4.  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  The patient was afebrile with no evidence
of fever.  On his hospital stay, blood cultures, urine
cultures, sputum cultures were negative.  Chest x-ray showed
no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  White
count decreased to 12 and no evidence of infection.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient received intravenous fluids
secondary to rhabdomyolysis and his anion gap.  As both of
these resolved, the fluids were discontinued.  The patient
was taking p.o. with a cardiac heart healthy diet and low
sodium.

6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was initially on Pneumoboots
and subcutaneous heparin and then was ambulating and
requiring these discontinued.  Taking p.o. and not requiring
any gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

He is full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Change in mental status, delirium.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Parkinson's.
7.  Seizure disorder.
8.  Post-traumatic stress disorder.
9.  Anxiety.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cardiolevodopa CR 50/200, one tablet p.o. four times a
day.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Lorazepam 1 mg p.o. three times a day.
5.  Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.

10. Cardiolevodopa 25/100, one tablet p.o. three times a day.
11. Folic acid 1 mg intravenously q. day.
12. Thiamine 100 mg intravenously q. day.
13. Acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o. q. four to six hours
p.r.n.

Date of Birth:   [**2131-8-12**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with
a history of seizure disorder and coronary artery disease,
who was brought into the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room on [**2189-4-1**] secondary to confusion.
Patient was reportedly found on the street in a confused and
disoriented state by emergency medical technicians and
subsequently brought to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further evaluation and management.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was noted to be disoriented and
confused with a CPK of 5712 and a [**Hospital1 **] of 20.

Patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at
112, inferior lead Q waves, and mild ST depression in lead
V5.  In addition, the patient was noted to have an [**Hospital1 **]
white blood cell count of 17.4, but was noted to be afebrile
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient continued to have
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the Emergency Department,
after which point he received head CT scan which was negative
and a lumbar puncture which demonstrated 560 red blood cells
and 1 white blood cell.  Due to the patient's [**Doctor Last Name **] CK and
[**Doctor Last Name **], Cardiology consult was obtained in the Emergency
Department.

A bedside echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%
and 2+ mitral regurgitation.  Initial Cardiology
recommendations advised conservative management with a beta
blocker, but no Heparinization given the patient's lumbar
puncture results.

While in the Emergency Department, the patient's mental
status was noted to improve gradually.  Although the patient
reported having no memory of the days events, he did report
being under a fair amount of increased stress over the past
several days secondary to his car being stolen and him
running out of his standard home medications.  The patient
was subsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team for further evaluation and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Seizure disorder.
2. Parkinson's.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Depression.
5. Anxiety.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Carbidopa/levodopa.
2. Effexor.
3. ............
4. Klonopin.
5. Metoprolol.
6. Diclofenac.
7. Lamictal.
8. Lorazepam.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone.  Works as a postal worker.
Reports a remote history of alcohol abuse, but states the
last drink was in [**2170**].  Denies any other history of drug
abuse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit team under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] on [**2189-4-2**].  Given the patient's
presenting symptoms and his lumbar puncture results, a
neurosurgical consult was obtained and the patient was
referred for head MRI/MRA which subsequently demonstrated no
gross structural abnormalities and no evidence of infarction
or intracranial enhancement.

Over the course of the hospital day #1, the patient's mental
status was noted to improve tremendously, and the patient was
noted to be fully oriented to person, place, and time.  The
patient subsequently stated that he would like to be
discharged immediately; however, following discussions with
case management and primary team, the patient was convinced
to remain in-house for the duration of his medical workup.

Given the patient's negative head scan and markedly improved
mental status with little intervention, the leading diagnosis
for his acute mental status change was believed to be a
postictal state.  The patient was subsequently restarted on
his outpatient seizure and Parkinson's medications to good
effect.  In addition, a Psychiatry consultation was obtained
who deemed the patient mentally competent, but described him
as exhibiting impaired judgement from his recently altered
mental status.  The patient was subsequently advised to
remain on an one-to-one sitter for risk of elopement, and
Ativan standing dosage was recommended given the potential
for the patient to go into benzodiazepine withdrawal.

The patient continued to progress well clinically through
hospital day #2, at which point he was cleared for transfer
to the regular medical floor, and was admitted to the [**Hospital **]
Medical Service.  While on the floor, the patient
demonstrated several episodes of acute shortness of breath
and tachypnea subsequently ascribed to transient panic
attacks that the patient stated were consistent with his
normal baseline.

On [**2189-4-3**], the patient underwent a repeat
echocardiogram, which demonstrated severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction
of 25% and 4% mitral regurgitation.  The patient subsequently
recommended for a cardiac catheterization, which he underwent
on [**2189-4-6**], which subsequently demonstrated three vessel
coronary artery disease with 70% proximal irregular stenosis
of the left anterior descending artery, total occlusion of
the circumflex, and total occlusion of the proximal right
coronary artery.  In addition, the patient's cardiac
catheterization demonstrated moderate right ventricular
diastolic dysfunction, severe left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, moderate primary pulmonary hypertension, and a
depressed cardiac index of 1.8.

Given these findings, a Cardiac Surgery consultation was
obtained.  Following a discussion of the relative risks and
benefits of surgical intervention, the patient subsequently
consented to undergo a coronary artery bypass graft and
mitral valve repair to take place on [**2189-4-8**].  On [**2189-4-8**], the patient therefore underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft using anastomosis from the LIMA to the LAD, and
a mitral annuloplasty using a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  In
addition, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted via the
patient's right femoral artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with a bypass time of 122 minutes and a
cross-clamp time of 79 minutes.

Patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed included an
arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, CVP catheter, and IAVP;
both ventricular and atrial wires were placed; mediastinal
and right and left pleural tubes were placed
intraoperatively.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to the CSRU, intubated, further evaluation and management.
On transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was 80, his
CVP was 19, his ......... was 15 and his [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 25.  The
patient was A-V paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute.
Drips on transfer included milrinone, epi, and propofol.

In the CSRU, the patient's IAVP remained in place through
postoperative day #2, at which point it was removed without
complication.  The patient demonstrated a gradual respiratory
wean, and was finally successfully extubated on postoperative
day #3 without complication.  Patient was subsequently
advanced to regular oral intake, which he tolerated well
through the duration of his stay.

On postoperative day #4, the patient's PA catheter, pacer
wires, and chest tube were removed without complication, and
on postoperative day #5, the patient was cleared for transfer
to the floor.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service in the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].

On the floor, the patient progressed well clinically through
the time of his discharge.  Physical Therapy consultation was
obtained, and the patient was cleared for discharge to home
following resolution of his acute medical issues.  The
patient demonstrated several additional episodes of anxiety
attacks through the course of his time on the regular patient
floor, all of which responded well to Ativan administration.
Patient's Foley catheter was subsequently removed without
complication.  He was noted to ............... productive of
urine for the duration of his stay.

On postoperative day #6, a routine chest radiograph
demonstrated evidence of a left basilar infiltrate versus
atelectasis; the patient was subsequently begun on
levofloxacin for a 10 day course to be completed as an
outpatient.

On postoperative day #8, [**2189-4-15**], the patient was
cleared by Physical Therapy, full independent ambulation.
Although Physical Therapy stated that patient would be likely
benefit from short rehab stay, the patient clearly stated his
preference to return home.  Patient was subsequently cleared
for discharge to home with home VNA services and home
Physical Therapy on postoperative day #7, [**2189-4-15**].
